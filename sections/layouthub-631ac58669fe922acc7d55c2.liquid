<b>*KEEP ORIGINAL PACKAGING*</b> - Customers are required to retain all <u>original packaging</u> in case a return is necessary. ShopSolar does not provide replacement packaging for returns, repairs, or replacements. The cost of repackaging items for a return will be the customer’s responsibility. Keeping the original packaging ensures a smoother return process and helps avoid potential issues during transit.<br><br>

<b>Receiving Shipments (Freight and Oversize)</b><br><br>

The majority of our orders ship via standard carriers (Fed-Ex, UPS, DHL, USPS) etc. However, depending on your order size/weight, you could have larger or oversized items that will require a special shipping service like freight. Please note that if you are unable to receive deliveries from a freight transport at your desired delivery address, it is your responsibility to make arrangements with the freight company when they call to set up the appointment. <br><br>

This includes situations where access is limited, such as long/narrow driveways that cannot accommodate large transport vehicles. Customers should be aware that failure to coordinate delivery may result in packages being left in unsuitable locations or requiring pickup from a terminal, which may lead to additional inconvenience & extra cost may be incurred.<br><br></div>

<b>Recommended Tools for Solar Installation and Maintenance</b><br><br>

Having the right tools for your solar system isn't just handy—it's essential for safe, efficient maintenance and maximizing your system's lifespan.<br><br>

<ol>
<li data-lh-list><b>Multimeter</b><br>
<ul>
<li data-lh-list><i>Purpose:</i> Measures voltage, current, and resistance, essential for diagnosing system performance.</li>
<li data-lh-list><i>Features to look for: </i>DC/AC measurement, continuity test, auto-ranging, and ideally a clamp function for non-invasive current measurement.</li></ul></li><br>


<li data-lh-list><b>MC4 Crimping Tool and MC4 Connectors</b>

<ul>
<li data-lh-list><i>Purpose:</i> Used for attaching and maintaining MC4 connectors on solar panel cables.</li>
<li data-lh-list><i>Note:</i> MC4 connectors are standard in solar wiring; a good crimping tool ensures reliable, waterproof connections.</li>
</ul></li><br>

<li data-lh-list><b>Screwdrivers and Insulated Wrenches</b><br>
<ul>
<li data-lh-list><i>Purpose:</i> Insulated tools protect against electric shock. Screwdrivers and wrenches are needed to work on inverters, charge controllers, batteries, and panels.</li>
<li data-lh-list><i>Tip:</i> Magnetic screwdrivers and tools with rubber grips are ideal.</li></ul></li><br>

<li data-lh-list><b>Cable Ties and Cable Management Tools</b><br>
<ul>
<li data-lh-list><i>Purpose:</i> Keeps wiring organized and prevents tangling or rubbing that could cause wear and electrical issues over time.</li>
</ul>

<b>Battery Maintenance Tips for Lithium-Based Batteries</b><br>
<ol>
<li data-lh-list><b>Keep it Charged:</b> To maintain optimal performance and longevity of your battery, aim to keep it charged above 20%. Avoid letting it fully discharge (down to 0%), as this can cause potential damage over time. Lithium-based batteries can be continually discharged to 100% depth of discharge and there is no long-term effect. However, we recommend you only discharge down to 80% to maintain better performance.</li><br>
<li data-lh-list><b>Avoid Extreme Temperatures:</b> Store and use batteries in moderate temperatures. Extreme heat can damage the battery, while extreme cold can reduce performance. Never store the product below -20 degrees Celsius or above 45 degrees Celsius. Operating temperature varies from one battery to another so always refer to the manufacturer’s manual.</li><br>

<li data-lh-list><b>Regular Use and Calibrate Occasionally:</b> Lithium batteries should be used regularly to keep the battery healthy. Long periods of inactivity can lead to capacity loss. Occasionally let your battery discharge fully and then recharge to 100%. This can help recalibrate the battery’s charge level indicator. This also ensures the battery’s BMS remains calibrated. </li><br>

<li data-lh-list><b>Use the Right Charger:</b> Always use the manufacturer’s recommended charger to avoid overcharging or damaging the battery.</li><br>

<li data-lh-list><b>Store Properly:</b> For long-term storage, please discharge the product every three months (firstly discharge it to 0%, then fully recharge it, and lastly discharge it to 60%)</li><br>

<li data-lh-list><b>Monitor for Damage:</b> Regularly check batteries for any signs of swelling, leaks, or damage. If you notice any issues, discontinue use immediately.</li><br>

<li data-lh-list><b>Avoid Overheating During Charging:</b> When charging, ensure the battery has good airflow. Avoid covering the device or placing it on soft surfaces that can trap heat. 
When in use, avoid using too many loads or over-discharging the battery to ensure that the draw is within the capacity of the unit and to avoid overheating.</li><br>

<li data-lh-list><b>Keep Contacts Clean:</b> Ensure that the battery contacts are clean and free of dirt or corrosion to maintain a good connection.</li><br>

<li data-lh-list><b>Educate Yourself:</b> Stay informed about best practices for your specific battery type and model, as recommendations can vary. </li>

</ol>
<br>
By following these tips, you can help prolong the lifespan and performance of your lithium-based batteries!</div>
