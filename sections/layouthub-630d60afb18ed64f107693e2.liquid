In fact, solar panels are actually at their most efficient in cold, sunny climates, rather than in hot weather. <br><br>This is because colder temperatures prevent the panels from overheating. Remember, solar panels use sunlight to generate electricity, rather than heat. Skiers and snowboarders know just how bright and powerful the sun can be, even on the coldest winter days! <br><br>Live somewhere with LOTS of snow that can build up on your panels? It’s likely that you’re living at a fairly high latitude, and mounting your panels at a fairly steep angle will be most efficient AND help keep snow from accumulating too much. <br><br>Ultimately, and depending where you live, you might just have to take a snowy trip out with a broom to clear off your panels anyway. However, after that, you’ll enjoy added power from the sun’s refraction off the bright snow!&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

Not only will buying direct mean that you will receive the highest quality components at the lowest prices, you’ll also save thousands of dollars on installation fees!<br><br>
 
It is also worth noting that US Congress recently extended and expanded the Solar Tax Credit which means you can now receive a federal tax credit of 30% of the total cost of your solar power equipment! In other words, for every $1,000 you spend on your solar power system, you could be eligible to receive a $300 credit on your annual return!<br><br>
 
It’s important to think of solar as a long-term investment. Like any good investment, a solar power system can pay for itself over time. Rather than paying for electricity from the local utility company, you can run your electronics and appliances off on free and clean solar power. Think about the savings on your monthly bills!</div>
